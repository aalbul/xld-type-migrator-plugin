# xlr-tfs2015-plugin

This plugin offers a rudimentary interface from XL Release to Team Foundation Server 2015.  It provides a configuration item for a TFS 2015 server and a createWorkItem.py script that creates a Work Item given Collection, Project, Type and Title parameters.

The functionality will be enriched with additional Work Item fields as specific needs materialize.
