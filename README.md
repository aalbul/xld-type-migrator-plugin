# xld-type-migrator-plugin v4.5.3

This plugin provides a UI screen that allows migration of an obsolete type to the new type that supersedes it.  The input is the obsolete type and deployment package info; the plugin will generate a new deployment package containing the new type in place of the old one.  A migration helper plugin containing a mapProperties.py method must be installed, for example, xld-type-migrator-was-plugin.
